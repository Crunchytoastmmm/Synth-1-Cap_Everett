      <p class="w3-large">When I first started this project I was not sure exactly what I wanted to do.  I knew I wanted to explore and represent something related to public health but I could not put my nose on it.  For a couple days I tried to narrow down what I wanted to choose for this project.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Then while standing at the bus stop, ‘it’ hit me.  I was the lucky lad to be downstream of a translucent killer that the person to my left graciously bequeathed to me, and many others while taking a long drag and blowing out.  The ‘it’ was cigarette smoke and the ‘hitting’ part was more of a cough.  My lungs squeezed forcibly expelling the burned byproduct of a cigarette.  Right then I realized, I will look into data about cigarette usage.

      <h1 class="w3-center">Let Me Tell you</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-large">Using the Center For Disease Control data website I was able to compile a list of data from 2005-2015.  With creating a line graph using data of people who smoke every day and former smokers, I wanted to see how this matches up with smoking tobacco use.  It is an encouraging inverse correlation to see as tobacco use declined former smokers increased.  This is a good thing, for a decline in both tobacco use and former smokers, would lead to the assumption that people were never transitioning to the category of ‘Former Smoker’, one could assume they have passed.</p>
       
       <p class="w3-large">As you see in the graph there is a sudden shift in the lines around 2011.  This was due to a possible shifting of demographics that took the CDC survey.  Before 2011 the CDC would conduct their surveys exclusively through landline phones, but in 2011 people were able to fill out the surveys either from a landline phone or a cell phone.  This has caused a noticeable shift in all of the CDC’s data even outside tobacco usage.  I was surprised to see such a sudden increase the percentage of tobacco use in the year 2011, but the historical trend of decreased tobacco usage continued from the new high.</p>
 		
        
       <p class="w3-large">I am glad I looked into this available data because I was able to really explore my own methods of data collection and it was of interest to see how just adding a method to complete a survey changed results, but still equated the same trend over the years.</p>
    
      <p class="w3-large">When I first began to research this topic I wanted to include tobacco usage in Allegheny County but I could not come up with any credible data pre-2009.  This caused the graph to look disjointed and not polished.  I would have loved to include those data points but it would have been detrimental to visual aspect.</p> 
      <p class="w3-large">This graph I hope showcases the correlation between people who smoke everyday and the overall percentage of smokers across Pennsylvania.</p>
