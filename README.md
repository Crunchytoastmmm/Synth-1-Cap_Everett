# Smoking-Use-PA
#I wanted to create a visual representation of data in relation to smoking tobacco in Pennsylvania. 
#<h3>I also want to state that the CDC way of conducting its data collection had changed in after 2010, for in 2011 there people could complete the surveyes with a landline phone and a cellphone, whereas before it was exclusively landline.</h3>
